# Running the Script 
1. Replace the syslog.log file with your own log file
2. Run the script.py file inside the error_script directory.
3. Your generated csv files will be error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv

#Note:
1. For a custom made solution, the script.py can be modified to fit your custom log file format
2. The log file is only read, and never written to or modified.
