# categorize-log-info
Takes a log file and counts errors. It also generates basic user statistics and creates two .csv files representing error type count, and user statistics.

# Running the Script 
1. Replace the syslog.log file with your own log file
2. Run the script.py file inside the error_script directory.
3. Your csv files will be error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv

#For a custom made solution, the script.py can be modified to fit your custom log file format
